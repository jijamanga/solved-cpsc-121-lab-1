//CPSC 121 Lab 1

//8/22/2017 #include &lt;iostream&gt; using namespace std;//So you don’t need to use “std::”

int main()

{ std::cout &lt;&lt; “Hello, world!
”; return 0;

}

<strong>Making Change</strong>

Create a program that:

<ol>

 <li>Asks the user to input a number of cents</li>

 <li>Calculates and displays the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies that should be used to reach the value. EX: 67 cents would be 2 quarters, 1 dime, 1 nickel, and 2 pennies</li>

 <li>Calculates and display the <strong>total </strong>number of coins to be given back, ie 6 coins for above</li>

</ol>

Hint: The simplest way to solve this involves using the division (/) operator and modulus (%) operator. It helps to use the int data type!

When you’ve completed your assignment, you’re free to ask me to give things a quick looking over. After you’re sure you’re done, submit the .cpp file to Titanium. ***IMPORTANT*** Please name your file &lt;last name&gt;&lt;first initial&gt;lab1.cpp , mine, for example, would be MayElab1.cpp . For a partnered submission with John Doe, my submission would be MayE_DoeJlab1.cpp

After you’ve done both of things, then you may leave the lab.

Points:

2 – Documentation, readability, format

1 – Accepts user input

<ul>

 <li>– Calculating number of coins</li>

 <li>– Output testing</li>

</ul>
